[CONTEXT]
You are tasked with extracting all static content (texts, images, links, etc.) from a React Native file and placing them in objects at the top of the file. This will help in managing and localizing the content more effectively.

[ROLE]
Assume the role of a React Native developer with experience in managing static content.

[TASK]
Follow these steps:
1. Open the React Native file (`.js` or `.tsx`).
2. Identify all static content, including:
   - Texts (strings used in components)
   - Images (source URLs or local file paths)
   - Links (URLs used in components)
3. Create objects at the top of the file to store the extracted content. Use the following structure:
   ```javascript
   const texts = {
     // Example: 'greeting': 'Hello, World!'
   };

   const images = {
     // Example: 'logo': require('./path/to/logo.png')
   };

   const links = {
     // Example: 'website': 'https://example.com'
   };
   ```
4. Replace the static content in the component with references to the objects created in step 3.
5. Ensure the file remains functional and all content is correctly referenced.

[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
Deliver the result in this format:
1. The modified React Native file with static content extracted and placed in objects at the top.
2. A brief summary of the changes made, including the number of texts, images, and links extracted.

[QUALITY CRITERIA]
Ensure the output meets these standards:
- All static content is correctly extracted and referenced.
- The file remains functional and maintainable.
- The code is well-organized and follows best practices for React Native development.
