[CONTEXT]
You are tasked with refactoring a React Native code snippet to be modular, easy to maintain, and follow the atomic component principle. The goal is to improve the code's structure and maintainability.

[ROLE]
Assume the role of an intermediate to advanced React Native developer with knowledge of atomic design principles.

[TASK]
Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the provided React Native code snippet.
2. Identify the components that can be broken down into smaller, reusable atomic components (atoms, molecules, organisms).
3. Refactor the code to create these atomic components, ensuring each component is modular and reusable.
4. Ensure the refactored code is well-organized and follows best practices in React Native and atomic design.
5. Validate the refactored code to ensure it functions as expected and meets the quality criteria.

[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
Deliver the result in this format:
```jsx
// Import statements
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

// Atomic Components
const AtomComponent = () => {
  // Implementation
};

const MoleculeComponent = () => {
  // Implementation
};

const OrganismComponent = () => {
  // Implementation
};

// Main Component
const MainComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <OrganismComponent />
    </View>
  );
};

// Styles
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

export default MainComponent;
```

[QUALITY CRITERIA]
Ensure the output meets these standards:
1. The code is modular and follows the atomic design principles.
2. Each component is well-defined and reusable.
3. The code is well-organized and easy to maintain.
4. The refactored code functions as expected and does not introduce any new bugs.
5. The code adheres to best practices in React Native development.
